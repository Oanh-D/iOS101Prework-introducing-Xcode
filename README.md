## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I am new to Xcode and Swift, so it took me time to read and watch video about how to use Xcode to connect a button to logic, and get to know about storyboard.

#APP BRAINSTORMING:
1. List of my favorite applications:
   - Candy Crush Saga:
     * It seems to be a simple game: players can easily win levels and gain rewards, but they get challenged and addicted to the game.
     * It is desinged as a free game but to be able to beat the tough levels, the players gotta either trade off their rewards or pay to buy more helps and lives.
     * The game is like an endless journey, but got broken down in small milestone where the players challenge each other to win each stage.
     * The app provides dark and light modes for night and day time respectively
  - Spotify:
    * Be able to download and make a play list of favorite songs, podcasts, and audiobooks
    * Have driving mode, and be able to play with the screen off
    * For music, the songs have lyric and karaoke mode
  - Magoosh: IELTS vocab app
    * provide academic vocabularies based on common uses and different levels
    * while learning, it filters out words that user knew and did not know
  - Daily Fast:
    * It's way simple to use
    * Do not bombard notification like other apps
   
2. Idea of an app

It's a time management app for college student. 
The app that help student manage their daily and weekly schedule, plan ahead all events they want to attend so they are compatible with studying and working schedule. For weekly schedule, class and working time are scheduled on fixed period of time, then assignments and due date are set on to-do list and notification. Daily schedule shows all the time frame of the day with class and working time; with other free block of time, student can input what they use it for; also, there's a reminder for completing assignment, and get input of the progress of the assignment (completed, half-way, or percentage).
There's also an auto-message that remind student about assignment, event need to attend, class/work time, and motivative message.
